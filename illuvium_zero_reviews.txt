Review: People need to know you can play this game as a typical idle builder game (free-to-play) OR the crypto version (requires owning a land NFT). The crypto version allows interaction with Illuvium's other games (currently Overworld, Arena & Beyond) through fuel sales, skin blueprints, etc. Even the F2P version lets you earn airdrop points with an account if you want. I'm enjoying the game quite a bit, love the graphics/music/mechanics and looking forward several major features in the roadmap!!

Review: Been playing this game since close to its release, and now you tell me, (via a google play store update) that the plot of land I was using is just for practice? We're talking about... Practice... Since we aren't talking about a game... Was the money I spent for credits in the shop, practice? I assume you will find a way to make this right. Because the only thing I've found enjoyable about this, is this review.
